Welcome to Roots - Renewal of Bloom! The objective of the game is to fight other players to get to the top of the hill and bloom! It will take time, though - 45 seconds to be exact. Play with your friends in this multiplayer fast-paced party game with crazy physics. Collect items spawning on the beach to keep other players off the hilltop, and use shields to protect yourself.
